# Simple Developer Diary

This is a web application developed by Team 34 (PTG) for CSE 110 at UC San Diego. It is a simple developer diary which allows users to create, edit, and delete posts, assign tags, and search through posts. All posts are saved to a local Sqlite3 database and are persistent through reloads. We are working on adding markdown support.
