# Simple Developer Diary

This is a web application developed by Team 34 (TG) for CSE 110 at UC San Diego. It is a simple developer diary which allows users to create, edit, and delete posts, assign tags, and search through posts. All posts are saved to a local Sqlite3 database and are persistent through reloads. We are working on adding markdown support.

## Tech Stack

This application is designed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Node.js and Express.js are used for the backend. The webapp is built using Electron.

## Testing

Automated testing for this app was done using Jest and Jest-Puppeteer, which were integrated into Github Actions.
