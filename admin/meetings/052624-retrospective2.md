## Issues
- Neo: Lot of work, need to add tags to post and database
- Ryan: Trouble with unit tests
- Derrick: Bottlenecking from important features and issues too large
- Austin: Merge conflicts
- Can: Github issues too large
- Sumukh: Integrate unit tests and e2e tests
- Jeffery: Bottlenecked by tags on the post
- Abhinav: Got to project late, lots of issues taken already

## Improvements for Next Time 
- Neo: Make sure issues you take aren't too broad, make smaller steps on Github Issues
- Ryan: Split the main issues into sub issues, pair programming suggested for productivity
- Derrick: Split up issues into smaller tasks to prevent bottlenecking and allow everyone to work on the project
- Austin: Smaller issues and features next time so merging isn't as big of an issue next time
- Can: Split up issues into smaller parts
- Sumukh: N/A
- Jeffery: N/A, css is isolated from the rest of the project
- Abhinav:

### To-DO
- Integrate E2E tests into workflow (already implemented)
