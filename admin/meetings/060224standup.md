## Ryan

## Sumukh
- Working on e2e tests.
- Itâ€™s in the pipeline.
- Neo is handling the tags and doing a good job along with SQL integration.
- Markdown support and CSS to enhance the appearance.
- We need to talk to Dev about how to package this project.
- Currently, the project only works locally and cannot be deployed to GitHub Pages since it requires local execution.

## Neo
- Tags are almost finished.
- The main remaining issue is the posts not saving bug.
- Should finish the tags today, and they could be functional.

## Mauricio
- Aside from debugging, there's pretty much nothing else going on.
- Waiting on CSS from Jeff.
- Considering working on Markdown support; it's good to try if we think it's feasible.

## Austin
- Aside from e2e integration, there's not much else going on.

## Abhinav
- Ryan and Abhinav will work more on unit testing after the meeting.
- He is reviewing the current unit tests to identify any issues.
- They have tested all current utilities, so there is not much left to test.
