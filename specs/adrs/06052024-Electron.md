# How we decided 

Our Sqlite database is local, so a website would be out of the question unless we implemented some sort of login and hosted the server remotely. Given our time constraints, we opted 
to keep it local and package it into a webapp. We plan to use Electron.js to do this. Our TA approved of this plan.


# Final Decision
We came to the decision to use Electron.js to package our project into a webapp.
